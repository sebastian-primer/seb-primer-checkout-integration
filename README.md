# seb-primer-checkout-integration

This is my first attempt at integrating Primer in a bespoke app! The server was implemented in [FastApi](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com) and for the frontend I used `React` and `TypeScript`. I hope that using these technologies allowed me to implement Primer using a tech stack similar to a potential merchant's existing project.

This implementation includes the following customisations:
- A custom `Pay` button
- A non-default locale setting
- Custom error handling
